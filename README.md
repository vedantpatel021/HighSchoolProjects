# Forecast App
- Application designed to tell the weather given longitude and latitude coordinates.
- Uses API call to fetch weather data using longitude/latitude and performs reverse geolocation to convert longitude/latitude to an address (APIkey expired for geolocation).
- Both APIkeys are expired and are useless as of now.
